 * A cross-platform mutex that uses exclusive files as the lock mechanism.

 * system's implementation of file creation operations. Use this implementation
 * only if no other mutex types are available.
 *
 * This implementation avoids using [flock()](https://www.php.net/flock)
 * because flock() is known to have some atomicity issues on some systems. In
 * addition, flock() does not work as expected when trying to lock a file
 * multiple times in the same process on Linux. Instead, exclusive file creation
 * is used to create a lock file, which is atomic on most systems.
