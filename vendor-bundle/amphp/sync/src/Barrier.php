 * A barrier is a synchronization primitive.
 *
 * The barrier is initialized with a certain count, which can be increased and decreased until it reaches zero.
 *
 * A count of one can be used to block multiple coroutines until a certain condition is met.
 *
 * A count of N can be used to await multiple coroutines doing an action to complete.
 *
 * **Example**
 *
 * ```php
 * $barrier = new Amp\Sync\Barrier(2);
 * $barrier->arrive();
 * $barrier->arrive(); // promise returned from Barrier::await() is now resolved
 *
 * yield $barrier->await();
 * ```
